# Tennis-Sport-Victory-Predictions


* * Data Source : Kaggle
* * Importing the required packages
* Upload the csv, log, file to Databricks
* * Reading the data file and performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis
* * Checked the column Correlation and remove the highly correlated features as to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, thus decreasing the risk of errors.
* Targeting a subset of columns for classification
* Summarizing the data to get overall idea
* Data Cleaning by filtering out null values
* Data Visualization for data analysis
* Dividing the data into train and test ration of 60-40
* To streamline the data, establishing the pipeine, and stablising one with Logistic Regression
* We need a set of optimal hyperparameter values for the learning algorithm while applying this optimized algorithm to any data set, we are using Paramgrid and * * * * * * CrossValidator for Hyperparameter Tuning, comparing and selecting the right model for the dataset
* We need a measure of how well a machine learning model generalizes to similar data so that on which it was trained,to provide more accurate outcomes. So we fit the model with the training data
* Apply the Classification model on the test data to test the model
* Evaluating the model
